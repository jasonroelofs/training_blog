1. What is this?

This is a quick blog in Rails thrown together to show off the benefits of
abstracting out your persistence layer.

This is a very quick app to show some of the concepts I lined out in my blog
"Abstract Persistence Logic" here: http://jasonroelofs.com/2012/07/13/abstract_persistence_logic/

The code found in here is shown in [these slides] from BarCampGR 2012 [link].


2. So what am I looking at?

This is a simple Rails app that does one thing very differently: it completely
separates model logic from persistence handling. You'll see in BlogsController
and PostsController BlogRepository and PostRepository objects. These repository
objects are pointers to the actual repository implementations in use (defined in
config/initializers/repository_mapping.rb).

You can find the current repository implementations in app/repositories. The currently
implemented repositories are:

  1) InMemory: Everything is kept in memory. This is used by the tests


3. [to do yet] Other implementations

If you look at the [branch name] branch you'll see the repository object usage moved
into the domain models themselves, leaving the Rails controllers looking a lot like
you're used to, but under the hood we still have the swappable persistence layer
from the master branch.
